     *
     * Result set after __sleep method must enable further usage
     * of result, as if nothing happened.
     *
     * Example of implementation can be found in {@see \RunOpenCode\Component\Query\Doctrine\Dbal\Result::__sleep()}
     * where database result set is transformed into array of rows.
